Fancy Cat
An Interactive Fiction by Scott and Ash
Release 1 / Serial number 220511 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Bedroom
You, take laundry, awaken on the floor and clutch the fibers of the carpet to keep from spinning so much with the room. This is one messy room. This is your room, you remember as you look around. You stand up, unsure as to whether you can avoid falling back down. You see there is a bed you must have missed last night. You should definitely pick up the pile of dirty laundry that sits on the bed.

You can see a bedroom door and a Bed (on which is a Laundry Pile) here.

An Interactive Fiction by &quot;Scott and Ash&quot; version 0.0.2
Release 1 / Serial number 220513 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Bedroom
You, l, awaken on the floor and clutch the fibers of the carpet to keep from spinning so much with the room. This is one messy room. This is your room, you remember as you look around. You stand up, unsure as to whether you can avoid falling back down. You see there is a bed you must have missed last night. You should definitely pick up the pile of dirty laundry that sits on the bed. The only exit is west.

You can see a bedroom door and a Bed (on which is a Laundry Pile) here.
